        <section class="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1995 by river enthusiast Michael "Rapid Mike" Johnson, Rapid Waters Rafting began as a
                small operation
                with just two rafts and a dream. What started as weekend adventures for friends quickly grew into a
                reputable
                rafting company known for its safety standards and exceptional guides.</p>
            <p>Over the past 25+ years, we've introduced over 50,000 adventurers to the thrill of white water
                rafting. We've
                expanded our operations to include five major rivers across the region, each offering unique
                challenges and
                breathtaking scenery.</p>
            <p>Our commitment to environmental stewardship has remained constant throughout our growth. We actively
                participate
                in river conservation efforts and follow Leave No Trace principles on all our expeditions.</p>
